                    <span>
                    I have been working as a psychologist with full registration since 2014. 
                    <br><br>
                    During this time, I have worked with people across the lifespan, within hospital and community settings. My most recent role has been working with young people and families as a school psychologist. I have worked with a wide variety of individuals, predominantly with challenges related to chronic health conditions. I have worked in services for obesity management, and chronic pain. My practice has been heavily influenced by providing sensitive interventions to those whose quality of life has been impacted by significant injury, physical trauma, or ongoing degenerative or pervasive/long term medical conditions. That being said, I enjoy working with any person who has an interest in enhancing their quality of life, and pursuing values informed changes. It is my belief that when we work closely to align our behaviour with what is most important to us in our lives, that we can live the most meaningful life possible. 
                    <br><br>
                    My therapeutic approach is most closely aligned with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Emotion Focussed Therapy, and Schema Therapy. I believe that all people have the capacity to heal and bring meaning to their lives, despite the many hardships that they may have faced. My work is guided by principles and theories, such as client-centred practice, humanistic psychology, Rogerian therapy, and values based intervention. I work with clients to identify their needs and provide psychological knowledge, theory, and practices to assist them in taking the steps to enhance their quality of life.   
                    <br><br>
                    As a Clinical Psychologist, I am trained in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions. However, this is not my therapeutic focus. Rather, it is my belief that by addressing the root causes of distress, we can move further than simply managing symptoms (which is the focus of typical CBT intervention). I utilise a range of CBT techniques, as appropriate, and in the case of when my client requests or prefers this approach, however, my focus is on healing the systemic causes of suffering in a client's life.

                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Supervision</span><br><br>
                    I am a qualified supervisor for all supervision pathways. I enjoy working with clinical registrars and provisional psychologists. Please contact me via email if you are interested in receiving clinical supervision.

            <div class="page-frame" id="FAQ">
                <div class="text-section">
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">How much does a session cost?</span>
<br><br>
                    Session pricing is based on the recommended rate provided by the Australian Psychological Society. The current session rate is recommended to be $280 for a 40-60 minute session. 
<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">How do Medicare rebates work?</span>
                    <br><br>
                    In order to receive a Medicare rebate, your GP must have completed a valid Mental Health Treatment Plan. This plan must be provided prior to, or during, your first session, in order for you to receive the rebate. Medicare rebates are processed after your session. 
<br><br>
                    The current Medicare rebate for a session is $131.65. This is the amount that will be returned to your bank account, after your rebate is processed. The out of pocket cost of your session will be 280-131.65 = $148.35.
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately, I am currently unable to see the following referrals:
                    <br><br>
                    <ul>
                    <li>NDIS clients (except for self-managed)</li>
                    <li>DVA white card holders</li>
                    <li>Worker's compensation clients</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">How do I make an appointment?</span>
                    <br><br>
                    Appointments are made through the portal above. This is my preferred method of booking, as I have limited time to book appointments outside of my direct work hours. 
                    <br><br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Where is the practice located?</span>
                <br><br>
                    Flexible Psyche is located in the Lantern Psychology Centre, at Level 1, Unit 5, 10 Thesiger Court (Rowland House) in Deakin. There is free and paid parking available in the streets and car park surrounding the consulting rooms. Make sure to arrive with ample time to find parking, as it can be limited during the day. There is free parking located adjacent to Rowland House within the large Thesiger Court loop, and along Denison Street. There are also free 2 hour parking spaces along Strickland Crescent.
                    <br><br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">What can I expect from my first session (and subsequent sessions)?</span>
                    <br><br>
                    Your first session will need to cover the legal aspects of working with a psychologist:
                    <br><br>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Informed consent</li>
                    <li>Confidentiality and the limits to confidentiality, including what information will be communicated to whom (information/feedback must be provided to your GP at 6 sessions)</li>
                    <li>How records are stored and maintained</li>
                    <li>Voluntary participation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    The first session is very important as it will help us to establish the reasons for accessing psychological therapy, the goals and expectations that you may have for therapy, and which areas we can address during the course of therapy. It is important that you come to sessions with an idea of the difficulties which you most would like to work on. Keeping in mind that this is your time to explore and address the issues that are most affecting you in your life. 
                  <br><br>
                    Subsequent sessions will focus on the issues that you have outlined in your first session, with regard to your therapeutic goals. Sessions will involve:
                    <br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Discussing issues that are important to you</li>
                        <li>Eliciting insight and understanding into difficulties and what might be causing them or contributing to them continuing</li>
                        <li>Learning and practicing psychological techniques</li>
                        <li>Provision of evidence-based information that may assist in addressing your difficulties</li>
                        <li>Monitoring therapeutic progress</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    The goal of psychological therapy is not to necessarily completely remove unpleasant emotions. Rather, it is to find ways to reduce the distress and impact of psychological difficulties on your functioning in daily life. 
                    <br><br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">What type of services are offered?</span>
                    <br><br>
                    Psychological therapy is the only service offered at this time. I am not currently able to complete cognitive, personality, achievement, or psychological testing. I do not write diagnostic reports for medico legal purposes. 
                    <br><br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Session cancellations</span>
                    <br><br>
                    Please provide as much notice as possible prior to cancelling or rescheduling sessions. Illness is not a predictable circumstance, and it is understandable that you may need to reschedule on the same day as your appointment. On the day cancellations may incur a cancellation fee, as I am unable to book another client into your session slot on the same day.
