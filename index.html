                    I have been working as a psychologist with full registration since 2013. 
                    <br><br>
                    During this time, I have worked with people across the lifespan, within hospital and community settings. My most recent role has been working with children and adolescents for the Education Department. I have worked with a wide variety of individuals, predominantly with challenges related to chronic health conditions. I have worked in services for obesity management, and chronic pain. My practice has been heavily influenced by providing sensitive interventions to those whose quality of life has been impacted by significant injury, physical trauma, or ongoing degenerative or pervasive/long term medical conditions. That being said, I enjoy working with any person who has an interest in enhancing their quality of life, and pursuing values informed changes. It is my belief that when we work closely to align our behaviour with what is most important to us in our lives, that we can live the most meaningful life possible. 
                    <br><br>
                    My therapeutic approach is most closely aligned with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Emotion Focussed Therapy, and Schema Therapy. I believe that all people have the capacity to heal and bring meaning to their lives, despite the many hardships that they may have faced. My work is guided by principles and theories, such as client-centred practice, humanistic psychology, Rogerian therapy, and values based intervention. I work with clients to identify their needs and provide psychological knowledge, theory, and practices to assist them in taking the steps to enhance their quality of life.   
                    <br><br>
                    As a Clinical Psychologist, I am trained in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions. However, this is not my therapeutic focus. Rather, it is my belief that by addressing the root causes of distress, we can move further than simply managing symptoms (which is the focus of typical CBT intervention). I utilise a range of CBT techniques, as appropriate, and in the case of when my client requests or prefers this approach, however, my focus is on healing the systemic causes of suffering in a clientâ€™s life.
